# Domestic Flights 2022 USA

  Welcome to the Domestic Flights 2022 USA project! This repository contains a dataset and code related to the analysis of domestic flight data in the United States for the year 2022. 
# Project objective

  The goal of this project is to explore and gain insights from the dataset, and to provide visualizations and analyses that help understand patterns and trends in domestic air travel.
# Methods
  - Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Data cleaning techniques such as data imputation and outlier detection are applied to ensure the integrity and quality of the data.

  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA techniques are used to gain initial insights into the dataset. Statistical summaries, data visualizations, and descriptive statistics are generated to understand the distribution and characteristics of the flight data. Key patterns, trends, and anomalies are identified.

  - Data Visualization: Visualizations play a crucial role in presenting findings and patterns in an intuitive and understandable manner. Various plots, charts, and maps are generated using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. These visualizations aim to showcase flight patterns, popular routes, carrier performance, and other relevant insights.

  - Statistical Analysis: Statistical tests and models may be applied to validate hypotheses and perform predictive analysis. Techniques such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, or time series modeling can be utilized to uncover deeper insights and make predictions about flight delays, cancellations, or other relevant factors.

 # Project Description

  Analysis of domestic flight data in the United States for the year 2022 to explore and gain insights from the dataset, and to provide visualizations and analyses that help understand its context.
# Conclusion

  This data visualization project demonstrates that despite the vast number of domestic flights in the United States, the rates of delays and cancellations remain relatively low. This indicates a consistent level of activity within the country's aviation network. Furthermore, we observe that certain major hubs handle a significant volume of operations, while some regions are not as well served.
